How to install/use:
	fork my repl: https://replit.com/@SkireScripts/DevmodeAPI
	first run `Bootstrapper` and it should install the latest Aegis Release!
	then in the settings tab input the api url and your done
	visit https://youapi/read and it should work

WARNINGS:
	DO NOT REMOVE THE `Aegis` SHORTCUT - cause then you need to remake it :(
	if it failes to install please dm me @ discord - x6x_0
	join the discord server also to report errors - when made (in making)
