pretty bad rn but i just started learning c# so im gunna make this my first project, it has full function, working on ui for now (doesnt mean there isnt functions i wanna add, theres alot)

fr the panels/buttons are just boxy, hopefully in v1.3 i will discover border radius 

but all the tutorials are +6yrs old so ima discover it naturally
